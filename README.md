# Jangos-Projects.github.io
Jango's Projects website is my official website I use to publish my projects whilst learning to code

I have been using Codecademy to learn how to build websites. This is my first edition to hopefully a lot more projects which i will upload here or on my GitHub page.
The site contains a simple welcome page with a about me and my pets page.

looking forward to creating more here!
