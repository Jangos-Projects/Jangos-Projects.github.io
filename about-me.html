              Hi my name is Jordan but my nickname is Jango. I am the creator of Jangoâ€™s Projects and I am using this website to develop my coding skills and showcase my projects that I develop throughout my journey.
              <br><br>
              I live in the UK in Essex and have recently got an interest in building websites. I have always had an interest in the computing world since my childhood, I have been building my own computers (mostly for gaming) ever since. When I left school I completed a course within Information technology studies, but then gained other interests in sports and chefing and found jobs within those areas. So after many years of going from job to job I found myself not really fitting into those industries, getting no job satisfaction, feelings of boredom, stress and unaccomplishment. My drive for any kind of career plummeted downwards, which hit my mental health hard.
              <br><br>
              I had a long and hard look at myself and what I had accomplished throughout my life and realised I should be going back to my roots and remember what I really enjoyed and what made me feel the most satisfied, which was working on little computer projects whatever it may be. As this would always make me feel excited to dive in and learn as much as I could about that project, It brought out my creative side.
              <br><br>            
              After my breakthrough I decided it was time to relive my childhood days and re-find my love and interest back though the computing world again, dive into learning and developing my skills in ICT. So after a bit of research I stumbled onto a website called Codecademy which is offering a range of courses. They have a section where you can do a little quiz and offer suggestions on what might suit my personality, which revealed front and backend engineer. This caught my eye as I've always wanted to explore deeper into the programming world. So here I am exploring the world of website building, developing this website to test my abilities with coding.
